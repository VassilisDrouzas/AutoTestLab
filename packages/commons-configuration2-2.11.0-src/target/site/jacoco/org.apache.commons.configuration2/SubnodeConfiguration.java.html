/**
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A specialized hierarchical configuration class with a node model that uses a tracked node of another node model as
 * its root node.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Configurations of this type are initialized with a special {@link NodeModel} operating on a specific tracked node of
 * the parent configuration and the corresponding {@link NodeSelector}. All property accessor methods are evaluated
 * relative to this root node. A good use case for a {@code SubnodeConfiguration} is when multiple properties from a
 * specific sub tree of the whole configuration need to be accessed. Then a {@code SubnodeConfiguration} can be created
 * with the parent node of the affected sub tree as root node. This allows for simpler property keys and is also more
 * efficient.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * By making use of a tracked node as root node, a {@code SubnodeConfiguration} and its parent configuration initially
 * operate on the same hierarchy of configuration nodes. So if modifications are performed at the subnode configuration,
 * these changes are immediately visible in the parent configuration. Analogously will updates of the parent
 * configuration affect the {@code SubnodeConfiguration} if the sub tree spanned by the {@code SubnodeConfiguration}'s
 * root node is involved.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that by making use of a {@code NodeSelector} the {@code SubnodeConfiguration} is not associated with a physical
 * node instance, but the selection criteria stored in the selector are evaluated after each change of the nodes
 * structure. As an example consider that the selector uses a key with an index into a list element, say index 2. Now if
 * an update occurs on the underlying nodes structure which removes the first element in this list structure, the
 * {@code SubnodeConfiguration} still references the element with index 2 which is now another one.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are also possible changes of the underlying nodes structure which completely detach the
 * {@code SubnodeConfiguration} from its parent configuration. For instance, the key referenced by the
 * {@code SubnodeConfiguration} could be removed in the parent configuration. If this happens, the
 * {@code SubnodeConfiguration} stays functional; however, it now operates on a separate node model than its parent
 * configuration. Changes made by one configuration are no longer visible for the other one (as the node models have no
 * longer overlapping nodes, there is no way to have a synchronization here).
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * When a subnode configuration is created, it inherits the settings of its parent configuration, e.g. some flags like
 * the {@code throwExceptionOnMissing} flag or the settings for handling list delimiters) or the expression engine. If
 * these settings are changed later in either the subnode or the parent configuration, the changes are not visible for
 * each other. So you could create a subnode configuration, and change its expression engine without affecting the
 * parent configuration.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Because the {@code SubnodeConfiguration} operates on the same nodes structure as its parent it uses the same
 * {@code Synchronizer} instance per default. This means that locks held on one {@code SubnodeConfiguration} also impact
 * the parent configuration and all of its other {@code SubnodeConfiguration} objects. You should not change this
 * without a good reason! Otherwise, there is the risk of data corruption when multiple threads access these
 * configuration concurrently.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * From its purpose this class is quite similar to {@link SubsetConfiguration}. The difference is that a subset
 * configuration of a hierarchical configuration may combine multiple configuration nodes from different sub trees of
 * the configuration, while all nodes in a subnode configuration belong to the same sub tree. If an application can live
 * with this limitation, it is recommended to use this class instead of {@code SubsetConfiguration} because creating a
 * subset configuration is more expensive than creating a subnode configuration.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * It is strongly recommended to create {@code SubnodeConfiguration} instances only through the
 * {@code configurationAt()} methods of a hierarchical configuration. These methods ensure that all necessary
 * initializations are done. Creating instances manually without doing proper initialization may break some of the
 * functionality provided by this class.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
