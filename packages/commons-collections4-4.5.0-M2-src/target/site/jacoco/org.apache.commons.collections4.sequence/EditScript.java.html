/**
 * This class gathers all the {@link EditCommand commands} needed to transform
 * one objects sequence into another objects sequence.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An edit script is the most general view of the differences between two
 * sequences. It is built as the result of the comparison between two sequences
 * by the {@link SequencesComparator SequencesComparator} class. The user can
 * walk through it using the &lt;em&gt;visitor&lt;/em&gt; design pattern.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * It is guaranteed that the objects embedded in the {@link InsertCommand insert
 * commands} come from the second sequence and that the objects embedded in
 * either the {@link DeleteCommand delete commands} or {@link KeepCommand keep
 * commands} come from the first sequence. This can be important if subclassing
 * is used for some elements in the first sequence and the {@code equals}
 * method is specialized.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
