/**
 * A class that allows complex initialization operations in a background task.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Applications often have to do some expensive initialization steps when they
 * are started, e.g. constructing a connection to a database, reading a
 * configuration file, etc. Doing these things in parallel can enhance
 * performance as the CPU load can be improved. However, when access to the
 * resources initialized in a background thread is actually required,
 * synchronization has to be performed to ensure that their initialization is
 * complete.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This abstract base class provides support for this use case. A concrete
 * subclass must implement the {@link #initialize()} method. Here an arbitrary
 * initialization can be implemented, and a result object can be returned. With
 * this method in place the basic usage of this class is as follows (where
 * {@code MyBackgroundInitializer} is a concrete subclass):
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * MyBackgroundInitializer initializer = new MyBackgroundInitializer();
 * initializer.start();
 * // Now do some other things. Initialization runs in a parallel thread
 * ...
 * // Wait for the end of initialization and access the result object
 * Object result = initializer.get();
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * After the construction of a {@link BackgroundInitializer} object its
 * {@link #start()} method has to be called. This starts the background
 * processing. The application can now continue to do other things. When it
 * needs access to the object produced by the {@link BackgroundInitializer} it
 * calls its {@link #get()} method. If initialization is already complete,
 * {@link #get()} returns the result object immediately. Otherwise it blocks
 * until the result object is fully constructed.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@link BackgroundInitializer} is a thin wrapper around a {@link Future}
 * object and uses an {@link ExecutorService} for running the background
 * initialization task. It is possible to pass in an {@link ExecutorService} at
 * construction time or set one using {@code setExternalExecutor()} before
 * {@code start()} was called. Then this object is used to spawn the background
 * task. If no {@link ExecutorService} has been provided, {@code
 * BackgroundInitializer} creates a temporary {@link ExecutorService} and
 * destroys it when initialization is complete.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The methods provided by {@link BackgroundInitializer} provide for minimal
 * interaction with the wrapped {@link Future} object. It is also possible to
 * obtain the {@link Future} object directly. Then the enhanced functionality
 * offered by {@link Future} can be used, e.g. to check whether the background
 * operation is complete or to cancel the operation.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * @since 3.0
 * @param &lt;T&gt; the type of the object managed by this initializer class
