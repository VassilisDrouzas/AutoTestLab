/**
 * Combines the monitor and visitor pattern to work with {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock locked objects}. Locked
 * objects are an alternative to synchronization. This, on Wikipedia, is known as the Visitor pattern
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern), and from the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; &quot;Design Patterns&quot; book's Visitor pattern
 * [Gamma, E., Helm, R., &amp;amp; Johnson, R. (1998). Visitor. In Design patterns elements of reusable object oriented software (pp. 331-344). Reading: Addison Wesley.].
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Locking is preferable, if there is a distinction between read access (multiple threads may have read access
 * concurrently), and write access (only one thread may have write access at any given time). In comparison,
 * synchronization doesn't support read access, because synchronized access is exclusive.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Using this class is fairly straightforward:
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;While still in single thread mode, create an instance of {@link LockingVisitors.StampedLockVisitor} by calling
 * {@link #stampedLockVisitor(Object)}, passing the object which needs to be locked. Discard all references to the
 * locked object. Instead, use references to the lock.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;If you want to access the locked object, create a {@link FailableConsumer}. The consumer will receive the locked
 * object as a parameter. For convenience, the consumer may be implemented as a Lambda. Then invoke
 * {@link LockingVisitors.StampedLockVisitor#acceptReadLocked(FailableConsumer)}, or
 * {@link LockingVisitors.StampedLockVisitor#acceptWriteLocked(FailableConsumer)}, passing the consumer.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;As an alternative, if you need to produce a result object, you may use a {@link FailableFunction}. This function
 * may also be implemented as a Lambda. To have the function executed, invoke
 * {@link LockingVisitors.StampedLockVisitor#applyReadLocked(FailableFunction)}, or
 * {@link LockingVisitors.StampedLockVisitor#applyWriteLocked(FailableFunction)}.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Example: A thread safe logger class.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *   public class SimpleLogger {
 *
 *     private final StampedLockVisitor&lt;PrintStream&gt; lock;
 *
 *     public SimpleLogger(OutputStream out) {
 *         lock = LockingVisitors.stampedLockVisitor(new PrintStream(out));
 *     }
 *
 *     public void log(String message) {
 *         lock.acceptWriteLocked(ps -&gt; ps.println(message));
 *     }
 *
 *     public void log(byte[] buffer) {
 *         lock.acceptWriteLocked(ps -&gt; { ps.write(buffer); ps.println(); });
 *     }
 * }
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
