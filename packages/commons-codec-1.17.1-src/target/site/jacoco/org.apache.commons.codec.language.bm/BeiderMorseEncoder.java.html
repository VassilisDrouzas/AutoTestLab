/**
 * Encodes strings into their Beider-Morse phonetic encoding.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Beider-Morse phonetic encodings are optimized for family names. However, they may be useful for a wide range of
 * words.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This encoder is intentionally mutable to allow dynamic configuration through bean properties. As such, it is mutable,
 * and may not be thread-safe. If you require a guaranteed thread-safe encoding then use {@link PhoneticEngine}
 * directly.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;h2&gt;Encoding overview&lt;/h2&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Beider-Morse phonetic encodings is a multi-step process. Firstly, a table of rules is consulted to guess what
 * language the word comes from. For example, if it ends in &quot;{@code ault}&quot; then it infers that the word is French.
 * Next, the word is translated into a phonetic representation using a language-specific phonetics table. Some runs of
 * letters can be pronounced in multiple ways, and a single run of letters may be potentially broken up into phonemes at
 * different places, so this stage results in a set of possible language-specific phonetic representations. Lastly, this
 * language-specific phonetic representation is processed by a table of rules that re-writes it phonetically taking into
 * account systematic pronunciation differences between languages, to move it towards a pan-indo-european phonetic
 * representation. Again, sometimes there are multiple ways this could be done and sometimes things that can be
 * pronounced in several ways in the source language have only one way to represent them in this average phonetic
 * language, so the result is again a set of phonetic spellings.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Some names are treated as having multiple parts. This can be due to two things. Firstly, they may be hyphenated. In
 * this case, each individual hyphenated word is encoded, and then these are combined end-to-end for the final encoding.
 * Secondly, some names have standard prefixes, for example, &quot;{@code Mac/Mc}&quot; in Scottish (English) names. As
 * sometimes it is ambiguous whether the prefix is intended or is an accident of the spelling, the word is encoded once
 * with the prefix and once without it. The resulting encoding contains one and then the other result.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;h2&gt;Encoding format&lt;/h2&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Individual phonetic spellings of an input word are represented in upper- and lower-case roman characters. Where there
 * are multiple possible phonetic representations, these are joined with a pipe ({@code |}) character. If multiple
 * hyphenated words where found, or if the word may contain a name prefix, each encoded word is placed in ellipses and
 * these blocks are then joined with hyphens. For example, &quot;{@code d'ortley}&quot; has a possible prefix. The form
 * without prefix encodes to &quot;{@code ortlaj|ortlej}&quot;, while the form with prefix encodes to &quot;
 * {@code dortlaj|dortlej}&quot;. Thus, the full, combined encoding is &quot;{@code (ortlaj|ortlej)-(dortlaj|dortlej)}&quot;.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The encoded forms are often quite a bit longer than the input strings. This is because a single input may have many
 * potential phonetic interpretations. For example, &quot;{@code Renault}&quot; encodes to &quot;
 * {@code rYnDlt|rYnalt|rYnult|rinDlt|rinalt|rinult}&quot;. The {@code APPROX} rules will tend to produce larger
 * encodings as they consider a wider range of possible, approximate phonetic interpretations of the original word.
 * Down-stream applications may wish to further process the encoding for indexing or lookup purposes, for example, by
 * splitting on pipe ({@code |}) and indexing under each of these alternatives.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: this version of the Beider-Morse encoding is equivalent with v3.4 of the reference implementation.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
